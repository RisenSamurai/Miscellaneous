# Miscellaneous Code Examples

This repository contains various code examples from my past work. These examples demonstrate different functionalities and use a range of technologies and libraries.

## Description

The code in this repository showcases various functionalities such as user authentication, middleware handling, QR code generation, card verification, database operations, email sending, file operations, password recovery, PIN generation, and backup scheduling.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Golang**: Primary programming language used.
- **Gin Framework**: Used for building web applications.
- **GORM**: ORM library for Golang.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- **SMTP**: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol used for sending emails.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure information exchange.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework (for any frontend code).
- **Svelte**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces (for any frontend code).
